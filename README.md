# Mini-project2

I do several training in mini-project 2, my first step is studying how to use tensorflow by taking advantage of the tutorial. After I finished my tutorial part training flowers, I trained myself part using a module from Google. For more information, you can use this link to find the official tutorial: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0 and you can check this link for the Google training module https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/tree/master/scripts
